CS334 NETWORK LAB EXAM 10/7/2021

1. Design and implement a small application to demonstrate the use of a TCP socket to compute the data transfer speed of your computer?

	1.a first, implement a client-server program
	1.b calculate the data transfer speed by finding the amount of time taken to transfer a file.

2. Design and implement a small application to demonstrate the use of a UDP socket, to compute the data transfer speed of your computer?

	2.a first, implement a client-server program
	2.b calculate the data transfer speed by finding the amount of time taken to transfer a file.

3. Design and implement a small socket programming application to transfer a large movie file (larger than 400MB) from the server and play at the client?

4. Design and implement a UDP based communication between two different programs implemented in two different languages

	4.a. program-1 written in c++ has a UDP client 
	
	4.b. program-2 written in Java has a UDP server 
	
	4.c. demonstrate the communication between program-1 and program-2 using simple messages like "Hi" and "Hello"
	
5. Design and implement a small web server program

	5.a. The web server sends the following HTML tags to the web browser, the client program:
	
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
			<head>
				<title>Page Title</title>
			</head>
			<body>
				<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
				<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
			</body>
		</html>
	
	5.b. The web browser (client) display the web page corresponding to the above HTML tags 

6. Design and implement a small packet sniffer program

	6.a write a socket client, which can read all the incoming network packets to your computer, let it be a socket client inside a loop, which iterate over all the possible ports, IP address is the one fixed to your computer
	
	6.b open your browser to receive some packets to your computer
	
	6.c demonstrate the packets captured by your sniffer program
